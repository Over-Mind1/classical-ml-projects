# üì± Mobile Price Classification Using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their features. Using machine learning models, we analyze key attributes such as RAM, battery power, internal memory, and processor speed to predict whether a phone falls into a low, medium, high, or premium price category. This project provides valuable insights for manufacturers and retailers to position their products strategically in the market.
