## Dataset
- The dataset includes FIFA player attributes, such as:
  - **Age, Height, Weight**
  - **Position, Club, Nationality**
  - **Skill Attributes (Passing, Dribbling, Shooting, etc.)**
  - **Overall Rating (Target Variable)**
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
3. **Model Training**: Applying multiple regression techniques.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models for better performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models based on error metrics.

## Models Used
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

## Results
- Feature importance analysis reveals that **dribbling, passing, and shooting** are the most influential attributes.
- Ensemble models like **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** outperform linear models in predictive accuracy.
- The final model achieves a strong balance between interpretability and accuracy.
